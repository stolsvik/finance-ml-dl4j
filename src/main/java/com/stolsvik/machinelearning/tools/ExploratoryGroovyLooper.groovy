/**
 * <b>tl;dr: Jump to the Example.</b>
 * <p>
 * If you have a situation where some costly setup code must be run before you can experiment on the result 
 * (e.g. load several million transactions into memory, or spinning up a big Spring context), and then want to
 * code-experiment on the result, e.g. summing this way and that through all those transaction, you typically end up
 * with very many restarts, giving the setup-hit each time. Even if you get that down to just a few seconds, the
 * continuous hit of that setup can severely hamper your exploratory hacking, reducing your actual coding time to just
 * percentages of "wall time".
 * <p>
 * Instead - <i>given that what you work on is NOT the setup-code, but the use of the resulting objects of that setup
 * code</i> - you can make a Groovy script whose first line is a call to one of the loop methods in this class. You
 * provide a Closure that performs the load and provides the result.
 * <p>
 * The looper will then fire up a script {@link Binding}, sticking in that result, bound to a key of your choosing,
 * and then run the exact same script again, using a {@link GroovyShell}.
 * <p>
 * Since the first line in the script is the call to the loop method, it will instantly go in there again - however,
 * this time a ThreadLocal will notice that the setup is already performed (or you can check the current script
 * Binding for the presence of the special value {@link #SETUP_DONE}), and instead of executing the setup-Closure,
 * the loop method will just exit. This results in the rest of the script being run - which have the result of the
 * costly setup-code in its Binding.
 * <p>
 * When the script exits, the looper will wait for you hitting Enter, and then re-run the script.
 * <p>
 * <b>... And <u>this</u> is where the entire point of this class kicks in</b>: Since the script is evaluated afresh
 * each time it is being invoked, you can go totally nuts in your editing, with full IDE capabilities. Any Exception is
 * caught, so even heavy syntax errors will be handled smoothly.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * You for example make a file "TransactionExploratoryScript.groovy":
 * <pre>
 * import com.stolsvik.tools.ExploratoryGroovyLooper
 * ExploratoryGroovyLooper.loop this, { _txs = Transactions.loadAll() }
 *
 * // Just to get proper IDE typing help inside the script
 * Transaction[] txs = _txs
 * 
 * def sum = 0
 * txs.forEach{ t -> sum += t.amount }
 * println sum
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If you now want to explore what the sum is if you only include the transactions where the amount is &gt; 1000,
 * or where the purchase was done on a Saturday, then you just change the code, and hit Enter in the console, and
 * your forEach line will instantly run, since the costly loading of the transactions setup code is already done.
 * <p>
 * <i>Tip: If you do things like the transaction-example, and speed is of the essence, explore both
 * Martin Davis' <a href="http://tsusiatsoftware.net/dd/main.html"><code>DoubleDouble</code></a> (instead of
 * Groovy's insistence on {@link java.math.BigDecimal BigDecimal}), and Groovy's {@literal @}CompileStatic annotation
 * (Note: that annotation can not be put on scripts, but on methods, which you can have inside of scripts), and of
 * course the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/forkjoin.html">Fork-Join</a>
 * framework. Notice also that Groovy will convert every double to Double (long to Long etc), and that you
 * cannot make Closures which return a primitive double: since Closures are built upon {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable Callable},
 * it must return an object. But you can force it through by making your own DoubleProvider interface which
 * have an e.g. "double call(V v)" method, and using {@literal @}CompileStatic liberally (You'll instantly
 * see the results on the run times). Also, instead of a ".forEach{}"-loop, check out how the "for(int i;...;i++)"-loop
 * handles.</i>
